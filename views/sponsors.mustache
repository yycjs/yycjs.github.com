            <h3>Co-Working Made Awesome</h3>
            <div class="sponsor-description">
              <p>Assembly is Calgary's newest center for all that is tech. It is a place that fosters entrepreneurship in the purest sense, a place to call home. Whether you're working as a consultant or you've quit your day job and taken the plunge, the first thing you need is a place be grounded, filled with like minded go-getters. Assembly is the best place to be and we are very grateful to have them as a sponsor and a continual supporter of the Calgary tech community.

            <h3>It Takes A Village</h3>
            <div class="sponsor-description">
              <p>Some of the best things happen over beer. Ideas are born, friendships forged, deals struck, communities built. That’s how Village Brewery began, friends sharing beers and dreams.  Village Brewery proudly supports Calgary’s artists and craftspeople and their bold ideas. We are ecstatic to have such an amazing sponsor that shares many of the same values as us. Please join us, lift a pint and salute the Village of Calgary. It takes a Village to raise a beer. And a beer to raise a Village.</p>
